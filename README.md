Design &amp; Make Project: Autonomous Obstacle-Course Robot with Catapult Mechanism

## Overview

This repository contains my **EG1311 Design & Make Project** (AY24/25 Sem 2):  
**Autonomous Obstacle-Course Robot with Catapult Mechanism**

Our team designed and built an autonomous robot capable of:
- Navigating an obstacle course with ramps, bumps, and tight turns
- Launching a ping-pong ball over an obstacle using a custom catapult
- Staying within strict size and weight constraints while optimizing for performance

---

## Platforms & Tools

- Arduino IDE & C++: for microcontroller programming and debugging
- TinkerCAD: for circuit simulation and prototyping
- Fusion 360: for 3D CAD design and mechanical modelling
- Basic electronics tools: breadboard prototyping, resistors, sensors, wiring
- Materials: cardboard, acrylic, corrugated board for iterative chassis and catapult builds

---

## My Contributions

- Developed and debugged the **Arduino source code** for the robotâ€™s sensors and actuation
- Designed and tested the circuitry using **TinkerCAD** for layout and connections
- Assisted in designing the robot chassis and catapult using **Fusion 360**
- Participated in multiple rounds of mechanical prototyping and testing

---

## Team Contributions

- Produced multiple design iterations from initial mock-ups to final working robot
- Created detailed **Fusion 360 CAD models** for the robot structure and catapult
- Integrated IR and LDR sensors for obstacle detection and autonomous navigation
- Documented the entire design and testing process in the final report
