Design &amp; Make Project: Autonomous Obstacle-Course Robot with Catapult Mechanism

## Overview

This repository contains my **EG1311 Design & Make Project**:  
**Autonomous Obstacle-Course Robot with Catapult Mechanism**

Our team designed and built an autonomous robot capable of:
- Navigating an obstacle course with ramps and bumps
- Launching a ping-pong ball over an obstacle using a custom catapult
- Staying within strict size and weight constraints while optimizing for performance

---

## Platforms & Tools

- Arduino IDE & C++: for microcontroller programming and debugging
- TinkerCAD: for circuit simulation and prototyping
- Fusion360: for 3D CAD design and mechanical modelling
- Basic electronics tools: breadboard prototyping, resistors, ultrasonic sensors, wiring

---

## My Contributions

- Developed and debugged the **Arduino source code** for the robot’s sensors and actuation
- Designed and tested the circuitry using **TinkerCAD** for layout and connections
- Assisted in designing the robot chassis and catapult using **Fusion360**

---

## Team Contributions

- Produced multiple design iterations from initial mock-ups to the final working robot
- Created detailed **Fusion 360 CAD models** for the robot structure and catapult
- Documented the entire design and testing process in the final report

---

## Repository Contents

- `/report` — Final project report PDF
- `/sourcecode` — Arduino `.ino` source code for the robot’s firmware
- `/media` — Contains a text file with a Google Drive link to the demo video
